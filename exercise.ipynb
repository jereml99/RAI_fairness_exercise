    "# PART 1: Fairness assessment and Bias mitigation using Fairlearn\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to learn how to use [Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) to approach basic fairness assessments and apply post-processing bias mitigation methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fairlearn is an open-source Python package originally developed by Microsoft Research. Since 2021, it has become completely community-driven. For more information about Fairlearn, you can visit [this page]((https://fairlearn.org/v0.10/about/index.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Fairlearn is likely the most well-developed package targeting fairness issues, it has its limitations. The most notable limitation, that might need to be mentioned at very beginning for this exercise, is that Fairlearn is primarily designed for tabular data ([this page](https://fairlearn.org/main/faq.html) under question: *Does Fairlearn work for image and text data?*). Therefore, when working with other types of data, such as image data, unexpected issues may arise. Fortunate enough, there are workarounds for most of these issues, which will be discussed later in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Fairlearn is a good resource and offers an easy approach for learning fairness concepts and handling lighter tasks, it may not be the best solution for researchers working extensively in this area. Keep that in mind :-)"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use a chest X-ray dataset and a basic deep learning model as the setup. It requires the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download the dataset/metadata/pretrained ResNet model. Note that in this exercise, we only use part of the data, and details are listed below. The full dataset can be found [here](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC). (For students in the class, you can find a download link on DTU Learn. For those not in the class, you can find the pre-processing scripts in [this repository](https://github.com/nina-weng/detecting_causes_of_gender_bias_chest_xrays).)\n",
    "* After downloading the materials, put the `NIH_train_val_test_rs0_f50.csv` under `./datafiles/`; and `nih_pneumothorax.pth` under `./pretrained_model/`.\n",
    "* Prepare your virtual environment: \n",
    "`conda env create -f env.yml`\n",

    "\n",
    "### Chest xray samples\n",
    "We use [NIH chest xray dataset](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community) in this exercise. Let’s take a closer look at the dataset. </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 108,948 images from 32,717 patients, each labeled with one of 14 types of lung or heart-related diseases/symptoms. For detailed information on each disease, you can find explanations [here](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC/file/220660789610).\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will use only one sample per patient and preprocess the images to a size of 224x224. Both the dataset and the metadata (in CSV format) are available. The dataset split is also specified in the metadata under the column 'split'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The split was designed for a different task, which required a larger test set than usual. As a result (as you’ll notice), the test set is relatively large (around 8k for training, 2k for validation, and 8k for testing). If you find that the mitigation or prediction process takes too long, feel free to downsample the test set. Just ensure you validate that the proportions of samples across different sensitive groups and disease labels remain roughly consistent with the original test set.  "

    "* **Problem 1: `estimator` in `ThresholdOptimizer` only accepts 2D input (tabular data).** This doesn’t make sense for post-processing mitigation methods, as the only relevant aspect here is the prediction scores from the test set. The classifier itself and the input data are irrelevant when optimizing the threshold.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Problem 2: The `prefit` parameter checks whether the model has been fitted in a simplistic way, leading to errors.** You can read more about this fit check function [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.validation.check_is_fitted.html).\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Problem 3: It requires the prediction function to return scores for both classes in binary classification.** This might be an issue if your classifier only provides the probability for class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How we solve this**: We create a fake classifier that accepts 2D input and reshapes it back to the original image size before feeding it into the prediction function. We trick the fit check by defining a fake variable and manually modify the output of the prediction function to include both classes if it only returns the probability for class 1.\n",
